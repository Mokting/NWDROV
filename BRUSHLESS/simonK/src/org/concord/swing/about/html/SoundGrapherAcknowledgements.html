<p>The TEEMSS Sound Grapher is for exploring and learning about sound waves.  The Sound Grapher can display representations of sound waves in both the time and frequency domains. The design of this application was inspired by the Apple ][ Sound Grapher developed at TERC by Stephen Bannasch in 1984.</p>
